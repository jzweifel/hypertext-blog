# hypertext-blog

A html driven blog thing that I'm trying to develop.

Doing so in a fashion very much inspired by [the-beth-stack](https://github.com/ethanniser/the-beth-stack). Huge props to [@ethanniser](https://github.com/ethanniser) for the great videos and BETH stack tools; if you ever see this repo; I wanted to learn so I'm redoing much of what your libraries solve so I can understand better how it works, but I'll probably switch to what you provide at some point. Thanks!
